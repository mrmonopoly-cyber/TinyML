## Overview

TinyML is designed to explore the intersection of F# and machine learning. F# is known for its powerful type system, concise syntax, and functional programming features, making it an excellent choice for developing robust and maintainable machine learning applications.

## Features

- **Functional Programming**: Leverages the strengths of functional programming for clear and concise code.
- **Type Safety**: Strong type system helps catch errors at compile time.
- **Grammar**: Implement the full ML grammar specification (let/let rec to lambda) including
also the overloading of the operators
